# Malware Classification v2.0
Malware Classification using Machine learning 

* Classic ML-based approaches tried : K-NN, Random Forest, and XGBoost
* Deep Learning-based approaches tried: ANN, CNN, LSTM, and GRU
* Implementation is using sklearn, numpy, pandas and pytorch.
* windows executable binary files are used as data.
* Features
  * Classic ML-based approaches: PE fie features are extraced and used
  * Deep Learning-based approaches: (1) Opcodes (2) Converted executables into gray-scale images
* This project is an extension of https://github.com/pratikpv/malware_classification
